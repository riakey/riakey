## ðŸª« welcome

this is the thing. it does... something. probably.
i made it during one of those weeks where time stops feeling real and you just sort of improvise until your eyes hurt.
what is this?

honestly? a bunch of scripts and functions duct-taped together with mild hope and reckless confidence.
it might work. it might not. sometimes i look at it and feel things. other times i forget i made it.
features

    logic, kind of

    errors, definitely

    strange decisions, always

    commented code? lol

how to run

    clone the thing

    install the things

    run it

    stare into the void and see if anything happens
